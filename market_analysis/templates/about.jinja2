    <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This app is designed to keep track of stocks that can be added to your portfolio.
        We maintain our user information and associations with a database,
        and use the <a href="http://dev.markitondemand.com/MODApis/">markIt on demand API</a>
         to get our information about stocks 
        in the user's portfolio.  We feature user accounts with two different levels
        of permissions for views.  Test modules have been created in order to ensure 
        proper functionality of the website.  To view the portfolio, we display a graph 
        showing percent changes, and we also have a graph showing price data for each individual stock.</p>
